Automatic Inventory Manager
===========================

![Project Image]()

Overview
--------
The Automatic Inventory Manager is a device designed to automate the inventory management process. This project uses a barcode scanner and a suction mechanism to identify, pick up, and place objects, making the inventory process more efficient and adaptable to various object shapes and orientations.

Objective
---------
To fully automate inventory management by leveraging a barcode scanner and a suction mechanism for accurate object handling.

Applications
------------
This device can be used in the following settings:
- Supermarkets
- Warehouses
- Passenger Terminals
- Dockyards
- Industrial Facilities

Components
----------
The device consists of the following components:
- GM77 Barcode Scanner
- Power Adapter
- Suction Cup with Vacuum Air Pump
- NEMA 17 Stepper Motors
- A4988 Stepper Motor Driver
- Lead Screw and Shaft Coupler
- Mild Steel Rods for Structural Support
- Bearings (Linear, Ball, Radial)
- Belt-Pulley System with Coupler
- Arduino Uno
- Arduino CNC Shield
- Breadboard

Working Principle
-----------------
The Automatic Inventory Manager follows a systematic workflow:
1. **Base Position** - Starts from the base position.
2. **Product Placement** - Positions the product for scanning.
3. **Scanning Barcode** - Scans the barcode to identify product information.
4. **Vertical Movement** - Moves vertically to approach the product.
5. **Pick Up Product** - Uses the suction cup to pick up the product.
6. **Arm Actuation** - Moves the arm to the designated placement location.
7. **Product Placement** - Places the product in the assigned position.

Vision
------
Future goals for the project include:
- **Industry Standardization and Mass Production** - Aiming to make this device widely used across industries.
- **Expansion into Other Sectors** - Potential to apply this technology to other areas by modifying the end effector.
- **Fully Automated Inventory Management** - Providing a complete solution for autonomous inventory management.
